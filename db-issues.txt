Dementia Cookie Database Issues

- Dementia 066-0: time marks are off. Excluded from the extracted 'par' sets.
- Dementia 291-2: .cha file is wrong (does not seem to belong to the cookie set). The audio file is correct. Excluded from the extracted 'par' sets.

- The audio format is different for the files listed below. They are encoded at 16 kbps, 8 KHz instead of 128 kbps, 44.1 KHz. Ignored for now.
  357-0.mp3
  527-1.mp3
  528-0.mp3
  539-0.mp3
  551-0.mp3
  563-0.mp3
  578-0.mp3

We should also ignore the corresponding .cha files when we perform NLP+audio training.
